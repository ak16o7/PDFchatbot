# PDFchatbot #
This Python script uses natural language processing techniques to create a chatbot that can answer questions based on the contents of a PDF file. The chatbot uses the Langchain library, which provides tools for text processing, question answering, and vector indexing.

# Usage
To use the chatbot:
First: Set up your OpenAI API Key

1. Place the provided PDF file or any other pdf file in your Google Drive account.

2. Update the reader = PdfReader('/content/gdrive/My Drive/<filename>.pdf') line in the notebook to point to the PDF file.

3. Launch the Python script and enter a question for the chatbot.

The chatbot will use Langchain's natural language processing tools to search the PDF file for relevant information and return an answer.
